-Our project is a compact decentralized voting application, employing Truffle, Ganache, Solidity, JavaScript, Web3, and MetaMask. 
It offers a simple yet robust solution to modernize traditional voting systems.

Features: 
  1)Transparency: Built on Ethereum, our app ensures transparent voting records, reducing the risk of fraud. 
  2)Security: Each vote is securely encrypted and stored on the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof results.
  3)User-Friendly: With an intuitive interface, users can easily cast votes using MetaMask. 
  4)Smart Contracts: Solidity smart contracts handle the backend logic, ensuring fair and automated execution of voting rules.
